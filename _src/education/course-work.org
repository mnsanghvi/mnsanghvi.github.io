* Course Roadmap

I am going to base the course work grid on what is currently
(December 2015) being offered at the university I used to attend.
With some modifications of course. :)   

I have not included the Humanities related courses or any other
electives.  There are also plenty of extra courses based on what I
would have liked to take as well, sort of like my ideal curriculum.

* Extra Courses

 These are courses that I would have liked to take as well, but would
 never have had time to take because of the actual course roadmap
 given above.  For some of them I did procure the text books in order
 to do things on my own time.
