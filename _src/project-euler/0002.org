#+TITLE: Project Euler / Problem 0002 / Even Fibonacci numbers

** Problem 2 - Even Fibonacci numbers
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the
previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will
be:

        1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

*By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not
exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.*
